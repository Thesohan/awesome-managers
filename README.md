I find that there are very few people who want to build their careers as technical _Software Engineering Manager_. Instead they prefer to be Tech Lead or Architect. People think that management is difficult. Why? Because they are required to have diverse skill sets and wear multiple hats to become an effective manager. For sure, these skills are rare to find in one person!
