I find that there are very few people who want to build their careers as Technical Software Engineering Manager. Instead they prefer to be Tech Lead or an Architect. Here is a curated list of articles and advice that help becoming an awesome software engineering manager!


### Behaviors

* [Servant Leadership](https://adl.io/essays/why-software-development-requires-servant-leaders/) -  The best managers see blockers coming and act early to prevent them from ever surfacing.

### Project Execution

* [Imaginary Problems Are the Root of Bad Software](https://medium.com/s/story/imaginary-problems-d4f2921bd1b8) - Just because they‚Äôre fun to solve doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre relevant
* [In Pursuit of Production Minimalism](https://brandur.org/minimalism) - While complexity is never a conscious design goal of any project, it arises inherently as new features are pursued or new components are introduced. KISS (‚Äúkeep it simple, stupid‚Äù) - a principle that suggests glibly that systems should be designed to be as simple as possible.


### ROI - Return Of Investment
