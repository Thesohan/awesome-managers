There aren't many engineers who aspire to grow into technical **Software Engineering Managers**. Instead, most seem to lean toward roles like Tech Lead or Architect. Why is that? Well, people often think management is tough. And they‚Äôre right. This role goes beyond just being good with technology. **It‚Äôs easier to tackle technical challenges, but getting people to work together and trust you?** That‚Äôs where it gets tricky. The real question is: are you up for it?

Being an Engineering Manager or Leader requires a unique mix of skills, and you **have to wear a lot of hats to be truly effective**. Sure, finding all of these skills in one person is rare, but the good news is‚Äîyou can always learn and grow. A great engineering manager should always be a learner, someone who‚Äôs constantly challenging their past perceptions, staying aware of the tech landscape, being the first user of the product, making decisions, mentoring others, and driving success for everyone involved.

Instead of diving into lengthy books, **I prefer to learn from real experiences** and advice shared by others. These nuggets of wisdom are often found in journal articles or blog posts, which give me a broader perspective on how others are navigating their roles and what I can do to improve. Below, I‚Äôve curated a list of articles and advice that have helped me on my journey to becoming a better software engineering leader‚Äîand I hope they‚Äôll help you too!

_Note: There are plenty of reading lists out there, but this one is my personal recommendation based on what I‚Äôve read and found useful._
